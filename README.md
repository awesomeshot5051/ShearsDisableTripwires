Shears Disable Tripwires
========================
MinecraftForge removed the ability for Shears to disable tripwires. The reasoning was that it was a bug that allowed things like the String Duper to happen. Vanilla Minecraft still has it, but Forge does not. When the great Forge-Neoforge split happened, Neoforge still didn't have this ability. In the upcoming 1.21.2 update, Mojang will officially remove this ability from Shears. But they've left the logic in the code. I used the logic to re-enable this ability. Litterally all this mod does, is allow you to right click on a trip wire and disable it. That's it. But a useful tool if you want a string duper.
